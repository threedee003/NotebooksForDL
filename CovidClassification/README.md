*This work was collaborative effort of Tribikram Dhar, Dept. of EE, Gourab Adhikari, Dept. of ETCE and Prof. Sheli Sinha Chaudhuri, Dept. of ETCE, Jadavpur University.*


Following were the objectives of this research : 

* To explore the possibilties of optimising chest X ray classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
* Reduction of number of parameters of the CNN.
* Effective use of parametric activation functions.
